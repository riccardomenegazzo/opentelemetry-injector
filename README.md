The OpenTelemetry injector is a shared library (written in [Zig](https://ziglang.org/)) that is intended to be
used via the environment variable [`LD_PRELOAD`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ld.so.8.html#ENVIRONMENT), the
[`/etc/ld.so.preload`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ld.so.8.html#FILES) file, or similar mechanisms to inject
environment variables into processes at startup.

It serves two main purposes:
* Inject an OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation agent into the process to capture and report distributed traces and
  metrics to the [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) for supported runtimes.
* Set resource attributes automatically (for example Kubernetes related resource attributes and service related
  resource attributes in environments where this is applicable).

The injector can be used to enable automatic zero-touch instrumentation of processes.
For this to work, the injector binary needs to be bundled together with the OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation agents
for the target runtimes.

Official RPM and DEB packages that bundle the injector together with auto-instrumentation
agents for supported runtimes are built and published from the
[open-telemetry/opentelemetry-packaging](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-packaging) repository.
The OpenTelemetry injector Debian/RPM packages install the OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation agents, the
`libotelinject.so` shared object library, and a default configuration file to automatically instrument applications and
services to capture and report distributed traces and metrics to the
[OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/).
This repository publishes only the raw `libotelinject.so` shared library.

The `opentelemetry-injector` deb/rpm package installs and supports configuration of the following auto-instrumentation
agents:

- [Java](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/zero-code/java/)
- [Node.js](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/zero-code/js/)
- [.NET](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/zero-code/dotnet/)
- [Ruby](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ruby-instrumentation)
- Python (disabled by default, see [Enabling Auto-Instrumentation for Python](#enabling-auto-instrumentation-for-python))

## Activation and Configuration

This method requires `root` privileges.

1. Add the path of the provided `/usr/lib/opentelemetry/libotelinject.so` shared object library to the
   [`/etc/ld.so.preload`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ld.so.8.html#FILES) file to activate auto-
   instrumentation for ***all*** supported processes on the system. For example:
   ```
   echo /usr/lib/opentelemetry/libotelinject.so >> /etc/ld.so.preload
   ```
   Alternatively, set the environment variable `LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/opentelemetry/libotelinject.so` for a specific
   process to activate auto-instrumentation for that process. For example:
   ```
   LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/opentelemetry/libotelinject.so node myapp.js
   ```
2. The default configuration file `/etc/opentelemetry/injector/injector.conf` includes the required settings, i.e. the paths to
   the respective auto-instrumentation agents per runtime:
   ```
   dotnet_auto_instrumentation_agent_path_prefix=/usr/lib/opentelemetry/dotnet
   jvm_auto_instrumentation_agent_path=/usr/lib/opentelemetry/jvm/javaagent.jar
   nodejs_auto_instrumentation_agent_path=/usr/lib/opentelemetry/nodejs/node_modules/@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node/build/src/register.js
   ```

   You can override the location of the configuration file by setting `OTEL_INJECTOR_CONFIG_FILE`.

   You may want to modify this file for a couple of reasons:
   - You want to provide your own instrumentation files.

   - You want to selectively disable auto-instrumentation, either for all runtimes or for a subset of runtimes.
     See
     [Disabling auto-instrumentation for all runtimes or specific runtimes](#disabling-auto-instrumentation-for-all-runtimes-or-specific-runtimes)
     for more information.
   - You want to selectively enable (or disable) auto-instrumentation for a subset of programs (services) on your system.
     For example, you may want to only enable instrumentation of services that match a specific executable path pattern, or
     to programs that do not contain certain arguments on the command line.
     See [details on configuring the program inclusion and exclusion criteria](#details-on-configuring-the-program-inclusion-and-exclusion-criteria) for more information.

   The values set in the configuration file can be overridden with environment variables.
   - `DOTNET_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_AGENT_PATH_PREFIX`: the path to the directory containing the .NET auto-instrumentation
     agent files
   - `DOTNET_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_MINIMUM_DOTNET_MAJOR_VERSION`: the minimum .NET major version an application (as
     determined by inspecting its `*.runtimeconfig.json` file) needs to target to be eligible for .NET
     auto-instrumentation; can also be set via the configuration file key
     `dotnet_auto_instrumentation_minimum_dotnet_major_version`. The default is `8`, matching the .NET versions
     supported by the upstream OpenTelemetry .NET auto-instrumentation. Distributions of the .NET
     auto-instrumentation that support older .NET versions can lower this threshold accordingly.
   - `JVM_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_AGENT_PATH`: the path to the Java auto-instrumentation agent JAR file
   - `NODEJS_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_AGENT_PATH`: the path to the Node.js auto-instrumentation agent registration file
   - `PYTHON_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_AGENT_PATH_PREFIX`: the path to the directory containing the Python auto-instrumentation agent files (Python is disabled by default, see [Enabling Auto-Instrumentation for Python](#enabling-auto-instrumentation-for-python))
   - `RUBY_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_AGENT_PATH_PREFIX`: the path to the directory containing the Ruby auto-instrumentation gem bundle
   - `OTEL_INJECTOR_INCLUDE_PATHS`: a comma-separated list of glob patterns to match executable paths
   - `OTEL_INJECTOR_EXCLUDE_PATHS`: a comma-separated list of glob patterns to exclude executable paths
   - `OTEL_INJECTOR_INCLUDE_WITH_ARGUMENTS`: a comma-separated list of glob patterns to match process arguments
   - `OTEL_INJECTOR_EXCLUDE_WITH_ARGUMENTS`: a comma-separated list of glob patterns to exclude process arguments
   - `OTEL_INJECTOR_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_DISABLED`: either `*` to disable all auto-instrumentation for all runtimes,
     or a comma-separated list of runtimes for which to disable auto-instrumentation, see
     [Disabling auto-instrumentation for all runtimes or specific runtimes](#disabling-auto-instrumentation-for-all-runtimes-or-specific-runtimes)

3. (Optional) The default env agent configuration file `/etc/opentelemetry/injector/default_env.conf` is empty (use
   `all_auto_instrumentation_agents_env_path` option to specify a different path). Environment variables added to this file
   will be passed to all agents' environments. **NOTE**: by default, environment variables which do not start with
   `OTEL_` are ignored. If you need to allow additional prefixes in a custom build, compile the injector with
   `zig build -Dallowed-env-var-prefixes=OTEL_,CUSTOM_PREFIX_`. This setting is build-time only.

   The `auto_instrumentation_env.conf` file format is the same as other configurations:

   ```
   OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://collector:4317
   OTEL_PROPAGATORS=tracecontext,baggage
   ```

4. Reboot the system or restart the applications/services for any changes to take effect. The `libotelinject.so` shared
   object library will then be preloaded for all subsequent processes and inject the environment variables from the
   `/etc/opentelemetry/injector/injector.conf` configuration files for the process types you've configured (Java, .Net, Node.js or Ruby).

When providing your own instrumentation files (for example via environment variables like `DOTNET_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_AGENT_PATH_PREFIX`) the following directory structure is expected:
- `JVM_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_AGENT_PATH`: This path must point to the Java auto-instrumentation agent JAR file `opentelemetry-javaagent.jar`.
- `NODEJS_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_AGENT_PATH`: The path to an installation of the npm module `@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node`.
- `RUBY_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_AGENT_PATH_PREFIX`: this path must be a directory containing `glibc` and `musl` subdirectories. Depending on the libc flavor that the injector detects at startup, the matching subdirectory (a gem home with the `opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation.rb` entry point) is used.
- `DOTNET_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_AGENT_PATH_PREFIX`: this path must be a directory that contains the following
  subdirectories and files:
   - For `x86_64` systems using `glibc`:
      - `glibc/linux-x64/OpenTelemetry.AutoInstrumentation.Native.so`
      - `glibc/AdditionalDeps`
      - `glibc/store`
      - `glibc/net/OpenTelemetry.AutoInstrumentation.StartupHook.dll`
   - For `x86_64` systems using `musl`:
       - `musl/linux-musl-x64/OpenTelemetry.AutoInstrumentation.Native.so`
       - `musl/AdditionalDeps`
       - `musl/store`
       - `musl/net/OpenTelemetry.AutoInstrumentation.StartupHook.dll`
   - For `arm64` systems using `glibc`:
       - `glibc/linux-arm64/OpenTelemetry.AutoInstrumentation.Native.so`
       - `glibc/AdditionalDeps`
       - `glibc/store`
       - `glibc/net/OpenTelemetry.AutoInstrumentation.StartupHook.dll`
   - For `arm` systems using `musl`:
       - `musl/linux-musl-arm64/OpenTelemetry.AutoInstrumentation.Native.so`
       - `musl/AdditionalDeps`
       - `musl/store`
       - `musl/net/OpenTelemetry.AutoInstrumentation.StartupHook.dll`

Note that the defaults provided by the RPM and Debian packages from
[open-telemetry/opentelemetry-packaging](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-packaging) take care of all of that, and it is not necessary to edit `/etc/opentelemetry/injector/injector.conf` or set any of the above environment variables.

### Environment Modifications

Here is an overview of the modifications that the injector will apply:

* It sets (or appends to) `NODE_OPTIONS` to activate the Node.js instrumentation agent.
* It sets (or prepends to) `RUBYOPT` to require the Ruby auto-instrumentation gem, and sets `OTEL_RUBY_ADDITIONAL_GEM_PATH` so the gem can locate its bundled dependencies. If `OTEL_RUBY_ADDITIONAL_GEM_PATH` is already set in the process's environment, the injector respects that value and also skips modifying `RUBYOPT` (the two variables are a coupled pair — injecting only the `-r` flag would make the gem look for its dependencies in the user-provided path and fail with `LoadError`).
* It adds a `-javaagent` flag to `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` to activate the Java OTel SDK.
* It conditionally sets the required environment variables for activating the OpenTelemetry SDK for .NET:
    * `CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING`
    * `CORECLR_PROFILER`
    * `CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH`
    * `DOTNET_ADDITIONAL_DEPS`
    * `DOTNET_SHARED_STORE`
    * `DOTNET_STARTUP_HOOKS`
    * `OTEL_DOTNET_AUTO_HOME`
    * Note that the injector will not append to existing environment variables but overwrite them unconditionally if
      they are already set.
      In contrast to other runtimes, .NET does not support adding multiple agents.
    * The injector first inspects the adjacent `*.runtimeconfig.json` file of the target application when it is
      available.
    * The injector stands down if the specified runtime version does not target a supported .NET version. By
      default, the minimum supported .NET major version is 8, matching the .NET versions supported by the upstream
      OpenTelemetry .NET auto-instrumentation; it can be changed via the configuration file key
      `dotnet_auto_instrumentation_minimum_dotnet_major_version` or the environment variable
      `DOTNET_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_MINIMUM_DOTNET_MAJOR_VERSION`.
    * If the `.runtimeconfig.json` file is missing, unreadable, malformed, or missing the expected fields, the
      injector proceeds with additional .NET checks.
    * To reduce the risk of double-instrumentation, the injector then inspects the adjacent `*.deps.json` file of the
      target application when it is available.
    * The injector stands down if that `.deps.json` file already references `OpenTelemetry*` packages.
    * If the `.deps.json` file is missing, unreadable, malformed, or missing the expected fields, the
      injector proceeds with .NET injection.
* It inspects specific existing environment variables and populates `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` with additional resource
  attributes. These environment variables need to be set externally (for example by a Kubernetes operator with a mutating
  webhook on the pod spec template of the workload). If `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` is already set, the additional
  key-value pairs are appended to the existing value of `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`. Existing key-value pairs are not
  overwritten, that is if e.g. `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` already has a key-value pair for `k8s.pod.name`, the existing
  key-value pair takes priority.
  The following environment variables and resource attributes are supported:
    * `OTEL_INJECTOR_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` is expected to contain key-value pairs
      (e.g. `my.resource.attribute=value,my.other.resource.attribute=another-value`) and will be added as-is.
    * `OTEL_INJECTOR_SERVICE_NAME` will be translated to `service.name`
    * `OTEL_INJECTOR_SERVICE_VERSION` will be translated to `service.version`
    * `OTEL_INJECTOR_SERVICE_NAMESPACE` will be translated to `service.namespace`
    * `OTEL_INJECTOR_K8S_NAMESPACE_NAME` will be translated to `k8s.namespace.name`
    * `OTEL_INJECTOR_K8S_POD_NAME` will be translated to `k8s.pod.name`
    * `OTEL_INJECTOR_K8S_POD_UID` will be translated to `k8s.pod.uid`
    * `OTEL_INJECTOR_K8S_CONTAINER_NAME` will be translated to `k8s.container.name`

#### Mapping Kubernetes Resource Attributes

While you can set all resource attributes with `OTEL_INJECTOR_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`, the additional environment
variables controlling individual resource attributes (like `OTEL_INJECTOR_SERVICE_NAME` or
`OTEL_INJECTOR_K8S_NAMESPACE_NAME`) are useful in Kubernetes for deriving resource attributes via
[field selectors](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/environment-variable-expose-pod-information/#use-pod-fields-as-values-for-environment-variables),
e.g. by adding a snippet like this to the pod spec template:
```
- name: OTEL_INJECTOR_SERVICE_NAME
  valueFrom:
    fieldRef:
      fieldPath: metadata.labels['app.kubernetes.io/name']
```

The following provides an overview of the intended mappings:

| Environment Variable               | Intended Mapping |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `OTEL_INJECTOR_K8S_NAMESPACE_NAME` | `valueFrom.fieldRef.fieldPath: metadata.namespace` |
| `OTEL_INJECTOR_K8S_POD_NAME`       | `valueFrom.fieldRef.fieldPath: metadata.name` |
| `OTEL_INJECTOR_K8S_POD_UID`        | `valueFrom.fieldRef.fieldPath: metadata.uid` |
| `OTEL_INJECTOR_K8S_CONTAINER_NAME` | The container's name (no field selector) |
| `OTEL_INJECTOR_SERVICE_NAME`       | `valueFrom.fieldRef.fieldPath: metadata.labels['app.kubernetes.io/name']` |
| `OTEL_INJECTOR_SERVICE_VERSION`    | `valueFrom.fieldRef.fieldPath: metadata.labels['app.kubernetes.io/version']` |
| `OTEL_INJECTOR_SERVICE_NAMESPACE`  | `valueFrom.fieldRef.fieldPath: metadata.labels['app.kubernetes.io/part-of']` |

The environment variable `OTEL_INJECTOR_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` can be set to key-value pairs derived from the
annotations `resource.opentelemetry.io/*`, to support mapping annotations like
`resource.opentelemetry.io/service.namespace`, `resource.opentelemetry.io/service.name` to their respective resource
attributes.

### Enabling Auto-Instrumentation for Python

Python auto-instrumentation is currently disabled by default and no default Python auto-instrumentation agent is
included in the system packages.

Python instrumentation needs to be enabled explicitly by providing a Python auto-instrumentation agent and a
custom injector.conf file with python_auto_instrumentation_agent_path_prefix set or by setting
PYTHON_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_AGENT_PATH_PREFIX.
The configured path is expected to contain two directories, `glibc` and `musl`.
Depending on the libc flavor that the injector detects at startup, either the `glibc` or the `musl` directory will be
prepended to `PYTHONPATH`, and thus loaded first by the Python interpreter.

Be aware that it is not always safe to inject the additional Python packages due to possible dependency conflicts.

### Configure the Injector's Logging

By default, the injector only logs errors.
Set the environment variable `OTEL_INJECTOR_LOG_LEVEL` to change the log level.
Valid values are:
- `debug`
- `info`
- `warn`
- `error` - this is the default value
- `none` - suppress all log output from the injector; this is useful for scenarios where you pipe `stderr` into another
  process and parse it.

The injector's log message will be written to `stderr` of the process that is being instrumented.

### Details on configuring the program inclusion and exclusion criteria

If you want to selectively enable (or disable) auto-instrumentation for a subset of programs (services) on your system,
the configuration file provides a couple of settings which can be used alone or in combination to produce
the desired outcome.

By default, all processes are instrumented. Each non-empty include setting adds a condition that a process
must satisfy to be instrumented — all such conditions must be met (AND across settings). Within a single
setting, entries are ORed: any one matching pattern is sufficient to satisfy that setting. Exclusions take
precedence over inclusions.

  - `include_paths` - A comma-separated list of glob patterns to match executable paths.
  - `exclude_paths` - A comma-separated list of glob patterns to exclude executable paths.
  - `include_with_arguments` - A comma-separated list of glob patterns to match process arguments.
  - `exclude_with_arguments` - A comma-separated list of glob patterns to exclude process arguments.

For example, in the following configuration, all program executables in the
`/app/system/` directory will not be instrumented, even though the `/app` directory is
included for instrumentation:
```
dotnet_auto_instrumentation_agent_path_prefix=/usr/lib/opentelemetry/dotnet
jvm_auto_instrumentation_agent_path=/usr/lib/opentelemetry/jvm/javaagent.jar
nodejs_auto_instrumentation_agent_path=/usr/lib/opentelemetry/nodejs/node_modules/@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node/build/src/register.js

include_paths=/app/*,/utilities/*
exclude_paths=/app/system/*
```
To give you an idea of what types of inclusion and exclusion criteria can be defined, let's
look at the following example:
```
dotnet_auto_instrumentation_agent_path_prefix=/usr/lib/opentelemetry/dotnet
jvm_auto_instrumentation_agent_path=/usr/lib/opentelemetry/jvm/javaagent.jar
nodejs_auto_instrumentation_agent_path=/usr/lib/opentelemetry/nodejs/node_modules/@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node/build/src/register.js

include_paths=/app/*,/utilities/*,*.exe
exclude_with_arguments=-javaagent:*,*@opentelemetry-js*,-Xmx?m
include_with_arguments=*MyProject*.jar,*app.js
```
In the example above, both `include_paths` and `include_with_arguments` are configured, so a process
must satisfy **both** to be instrumented. We'll instrument programs that:
  - run from the `/app` or `/utilities` directories, or have an `.exe` extension (`include_paths`)
  - **and** have a command line argument matching `*MyProject*.jar` or ending in `app.js` (`include_with_arguments`)
  - however, even if both include conditions are met, the injector **will avoid** programs that have:
    - a command line argument starting with `-javaagent:`
    - a command line argument containing `@opentelemetry-js`
    - a maximum memory argument matching `-Xmx?m` (single digit megabytes)

The example above illustrates how we avoid telemetry from unwanted applications or
injecting auto-instrumentation to programs that are already instrumented. If you have a
standard way of deploying all of your applications, you can create a default `injector.conf`
file that will ensure you get only the telemetry you want.

Multiple lines of the same setting are combined as a union (OR). This means that if you define multiple
lines of `include_paths`, for example, the resulting patterns list will be a union of all of the lines.
This allows for easier manipulation of the configuration file with automated tools. Essentially, you can
list each pattern on a separate line. Note that different settings (e.g. `include_paths` and
`include_with_arguments`) are ANDed together — a process must satisfy each configured include setting.
For example, the following two configuration files have an identical outcome:
```
include_paths=/app/*,/utilities/*,*.exe
```
is the same as:
```
include_paths=/app/*
include_paths=/utilities/*
include_paths=*.exe
```

### Disabling auto-instrumentation for all runtimes or specific runtimes

To disable auto-instrumentation for all runtimes, set `auto_instrumentation_disabled=*` in the configuration file,
or set `OTEL_INJECTOR_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_DISABLED=*` as an environment variable.
To selectively disable auto-instrumentation for one or more specific runtimes, set `auto_instrumentation_disabled`
or `OTEL_INJECTOR_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_DISABLED` to a comma-separated list of runtime names.
Valid runtime names are:
- `dotnet`
- `jvm`
- `nodejs`
- `python`
- `ruby`

The injector will log a warning for unknown runtime names in the comma-separated list.

For example, the following configuration file would leave JVM and Node.js auto-instrumentation active, while disabling
.NET and Python auto-instrumentation:
```
jvm_auto_instrumentation_agent_path=/usr/lib/opentelemetry/jvm/javaagent.jar
nodejs_auto_instrumentation_agent_path=/usr/lib/opentelemetry/nodejs/node_modules/@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node/build/src/register.js
auto_instrumentation_disabled=dotnet,python
```

You can also disable a specific runtime by setting its agent-path environment variable (or configuration-file key)
to the empty string. For example, `RUBY_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_AGENT_PATH_PREFIX=` disables Ruby auto-instrumentation
for a single process without touching the shared configuration. The same applies to `PYTHON_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_AGENT_PATH_PREFIX`,
`DOTNET_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_AGENT_PATH_PREFIX`, `JVM_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_AGENT_PATH`, and `NODEJS_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_AGENT_PATH`.

Note that the injector might still add additional resource attributes to applications, by adding or extending
`OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`, even when auto-instrumentation is disabled.
See [Disabling the injector completely for specific workloads](#disabling-the-injector-completely-for-specific-workloads)
for an option that also disables this part.

### Disabling the injector completely for specific workloads

The injector can be installed globally on the host in [`/etc/ld.so.preload`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ld.so.8.html#FILES)
or for all workloads in a Kubernetes cluster/namespace. Therefore, we provide an option for you to disable the 
injector for a specific program launch or workload by setting the environment variable `OTEL_INJECTOR_DISABLED=true`.
When `OTEL_INJECTOR_DISABLED` is set to `true`, no environment variables will be modified by the injector.


## Design

This is a short summary of how the injector works internally:
1. Find out which libc the process binds, if any. This is usually either glibc or musl.
   (Some OpenTelemetry SDKs need to be injected differently, e.g. using different binaries depending on the libc
   flavor.)
2. If the process does not bind a libc, or it cannot be identified, the injector aborts injection and hands back control
   to the host process.
3. Find the location of the `dlsym` function in the loaded libc (in memory), reading ELF metadata.
4. Use the libc's `dlsym` handle to look up more symbols in memory, in particular `getenv` and `setenv`.
5. Again, if looking up any of the symbols fails, the injector aborts injection and hands back control to the host
   process.
6. Use the `getenv` function to read the current environment of the process (before adding or modifying any environment
   variables).
7. Use the `setenv` function to add or modify environment variables to add and activate OpenTelemetry
   SDKs/auto-instrumentation agents for supported runtimes (e.g. `NODE_OPTIONS`, `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`,
   `CORECLR_PROFILER`).
8. Use the pointer to the `setenv` symbol to add or modify `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`.

There is a much more detailed explanation of this approach, and on alternative approaches and the intricate design
constraints in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).
